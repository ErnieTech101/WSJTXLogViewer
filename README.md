# WSJTXLogViewer
Terminal interface utility to view your WSJT-X QSO's made in real-time

Drop the WSJTXLogViewer.exe file in your 'C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\WSJT-X' directory. Double-click it or open it via the command line. It will read the wsjtx_log.adi file and display your QSO's in realtime. No GUI, it's a text utility.
